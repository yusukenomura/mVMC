# mVMC

A numerical solver package for a wide range of quantum lattice models based on many-variable Variational Monte Carlo method

====
mVMC (many-variable Variational Monte Carlo method)
is a software for performing the highly-accurate 
variational Monte Carlo calculations
with the simple and flexible user interface.
mVMC also supports the large-scale parallelization.
For the conventional models in strongly correlated electron systems such as the Hubbard model, the Heisenberg model, and the Kondo-lattice model,
users can perform the calculation by preparing the one input files whose length is shorter than ten lines.  
By using the same input file, users can perform the exact diagonalization through [HPhi](https://github.com/QLMS/HPhi/releases).
Thus, it is easy to examine the accuracy of the variational calculation for small system sizes
and to perform the calculations 
for large system sizes that can not be treated 
by the exact diagonalization.
A broad spectrum of users including experimental scientists is cordially welcome.
